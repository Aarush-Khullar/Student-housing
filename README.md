# Student-housing
Building a console-based program in C to help students from different universities find suitable housing matches during inter-university events.  Each user (student) has a profile containing details such as: 
1) Name  
2) University  
3) Housing preferences (e.g., single room, shared room, apartment)  
4) Availability status

The system should:
1)Allow users to create and view profiles.

2)Suggest housing matches based on profile compatibility (for example, matching housing preferences, ensuring different universities, and considering availability).

3)Enable basic messaging between matched users within the console.
